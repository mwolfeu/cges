For too long, women, trans folks, and gender minorities have been left behind by researchers, advocates, and impact litigation efforts. This exclusion exists for multiple reasons, including the sense that because there are comparatively fewer women behind bars, that efforts would be better spent studying, advocating for, and litigating on behalf of incarcerated men. However, women’s incarceration rates are growing faster than those of men. As of 2023, the population of incarcerated women in the United States was six times higher than in 1980 (The Sentencing Project, 2023). ",

Over the last thirty years she has helped defend hundreds of men and women facing execution around the world. She began her career as a staff attorney at the Texas Resource Center, where she defended persons facing execution in post-conviction proceedings for four years. Following a five-year stint as a public defender in Minneapolis, she served for six years as the founding director of the Mexican Capital Legal Assistance Program, a project funded by the Government of Mexico to defend Mexican nationals facing the death penalty in the U.S. In that capacity she provided litigation support to attorneys around the country, defended Mexican nationals facing execution, and represented Mexico before the International Court of Justice in Avena and Other Mexican Nationals. In 2006, she became a Clinical Professor at Northwestern Law School, where she spearheaded a ten-year project in Malawi that ultimately resulted in the release of over 250 prisoners, 150 of whom were formerly sentenced to death. She moved to Cornell Law in 2014, where she founded the Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide. In 2018, together with her colleagues at CDPW, she launched the Alice Project, a global movement to end extreme sentencing of women and gender non-conforming individuals. Her clinic currently represents women facing the death penalty in the United States, Malawi, and Tanzania. She has authored numerous articles, book chapters and reports on the application of the death penalty under international law. She teaches classes in international human rights, gender rights, and the death penalty. In September 2021, she received the American Bar Association’s John Paul Stevens Guiding Hand of Counsel Award, given to one capital defender every two years whose work has improved the legal representation of persons facing the death penalty and contributed to systemic reform.",

Additionally, we have compiled a library of resources on a variety of topics relating to the defense of women and gender minorities, which we can make available to advocates who sign up at the portal below.

We are committed to publishing data and research that increases knowledge about incarcerated women and their experiences. At the same time, we recognize that many incarcerated women do not wish to be publicly identified, and we believe in giving them control over how their stories are shared. For this reason, we do not share the names of people on death row or any information about their cases unless they or their legal representatives have given us express permission to do so. Where we receive that permission, we will share information on advocacy campaigns for women at risk of execution. We will also share anonymized data and studies that can assist in broadening awareness about the intersection of gender and the death penalty. ",
